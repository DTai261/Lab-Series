After you have successfully connected, Submit the answer **`start`**.\n\n## Sandbox GUI access\n\n1. Download the SSH access zip file from Training Level of the Linear Training Run page with topology visualization (in case of Adaptive Training Run, download it from the Training Phase).\n\n2. Extract the ssh-access.zip file to the ~/.ssh/ directory:\n\n>> `$ unzip ssh-access.zip -d ~/.ssh/`\n\n> Extracted files:\n> \n> >     ~/.ssh/pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-config: the SSH configuration file.\n> >     ~/.ssh/pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-key: the sandbox user SSH private key.\n> >     ~/.ssh/pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-key.pub: the sandbox user SSH public key.\n\n3. Copy content in the file **`pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-config`** to the file **`~/.ssh/config`** (if the file is not exist, create one) \n4. Run this command:\n\n>> `$ ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 -N -i pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-key user@client`\n\n5. Install any VNCviewr (You can refer to this [site](https://linuxhint.com/install-realvnc-vnc-viewer-linux/)) then connect to **`localhost:5901`** with password is \"**`password`**\"\n\n## Sandbox SSH access\n- Do the first 2 step as instruction above. Connect directly to any virtual machine using SSH protocol:\n\n>> `$ ssh -F ~/.ssh/pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-config <vm_name>`\n\n>> the **`<vm_name>`** can be **`user@client`** or **`user@server`** or any other.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use SSH to connect to the machine. SSH access makes it easier to copy-paste commands and flags, but requires more steps to set up. See [documentation](https://docs.crp.kypo.muni.cz/user-guide-advanced/sandboxes/sandbox-access/#user-access) for more details.",
