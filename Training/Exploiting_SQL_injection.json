Copy content in the file **`pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-config`** to the file **`~/.ssh/config`** (if the file is not exist, create one) \n4.

Connect directly to any virtual machine using SSH protocol:\n\n>> `$ ssh -F ~/.ssh/pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-config <vm_name>`\n\n>> the **`<vm_name>`** can be **`user@client`** or **`user@server`** or any other.\n\n## Web Student management access\n\n- The Page is use for manager student, there is few function for you to looking around. Notice that there is a button in the bottom right in index, when ever you mess up\n with the data in the page, you can restore database by clicking on that button.\n\n**`Note:`**\n- You can found browser, wireshark or another app by click on the **Applications button** in the top left of the screen\n- Use **firefox** in **Internet** instead of using default web browser\n\nAlternatively, you can use SSH to connect to the machine. SSH access makes it easier to copy-paste commands and flags, but requires more steps to set up.
